# CLAUDE.md

This file tells Claude how to work in this project. Read it at the start of every session and follow it.

---

## 1. Project overview

- **What this project does:** This project develops stable downloaders for slc and orbit files (if available precise orbit files) from CDSE.  
- **Tech stack:** Python, libraries that are needed for the aim

## 2. Access to the codebase

- You may **read any file** in this repository to understand context before making changes.
- Before changing code, look at related files (callers, tests, config) so changes fit the existing design.
- Do **not** read or print secrets. Treat files like `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem` and credential files as off-limits for output — never copy their values into code, logs, commits or chat.
- Ask before deleting files, renaming many files, or running commands that are hard to undo (e.g. dropping databases, force-pushing, mass refactors).

## 3. How to write code

### Clarity first
- Write code that is **easy to read and understand**. Prefer simple and obvious over clever and short.
- Use **descriptive names** for variables, functions, classes and files. `calculate_monthly_total()` beats `calc()`.
- Keep functions **small and focused** — one function, one job. If a function needs a long comment to explain *what* it does, consider splitting it.
- Avoid deep nesting. Use early returns to keep the main logic flat.
- Avoid magic numbers and strings — put them in named constants.
- Don't add abstractions, patterns or dependencies "for later". Add them when they are actually needed.

### Consistency
- Follow the style, naming and patterns **already used in the codebase**.
- If there is a formatter or linter configured, follow it.
- Don't reformat unrelated code in the same change.

### Error handling
- Handle errors explicitly and give clear, helpful error messages.
- Never silently swallow errors.

### Dependencies
- Prefer the standard library and existing dependencies.
- Ask before adding a new library, and explain why it's needed.

## 4. Comments

The goal: someone new to the project should understand what the code does and **why**.

- Add a short **header comment at the top of each file** explaining what the file is for.
- Add a **docstring / doc comment to every function, class and module** describing:
  - what it does,
  - its parameters and return value,
  - any errors it can raise or important side effects.
- Use inline comments to explain **why** something is done, especially for non-obvious logic, workarounds, or business rules. Don't comment the obvious (`i += 1  # add one to i`).
- Keep comments **up to date** — when you change code, update the comments that describe it.
- Mark unfinished work clearly with `TODO:` and a short explanation.

---

## 5. File structure

- Keep the file structure **simple, flat and predictable**.
- Group files by feature or purpose, with folder names that make their content obvious.
- One main concept per file. Split files that grow too large or do too many things.
- Put tests in a clear, consistent place (e.g. a `tests/` folder mirroring the source structure).
- Keep configuration in the project root or a dedicated `config/` folder.
- Before creating a new file or folder, check whether an existing one is the right place.
- When you add or move files, update the structure section in `README.md`.

## 6. Documentation (README.md)

`README.md` is the main documentation for this project. Keep it accurate.

It should always contain:
1. **What the project is** and what it does.
2. **How to install and set it up** (requirements, environment variables — names only, never values).
3. **How to run it** and **how to run tests**.
4. **Project structure** — a short overview of the main folders and files and what they contain.
5. **How it works** — the main parts of the system and how they fit together.
6. **How to use it** — key features, examples, API endpoints or commands.

Rules:
- **Update `README.md` whenever a change affects** setup, usage, structure, configuration or behavior.
- Write in plain language. Explain it as you would to a new developer joining the project.
- Use examples where they help.

## 7. Workflow

1. **Understand first.** Read the relevant code and ask questions if the request is unclear before writing lots of code.
2. **Plan bigger changes.** For anything beyond a small fix, briefly describe your plan before implementing.
3. **Make small, focused changes.** One logical change at a time.
4. **Test.** Add or update tests for new behavior and bug fixes. Run the tests and make sure they pass.
5. **Update docs and comments** as part of the same change.
6. **Summarize.** At the end, briefly explain what you changed, which files were touched, and anything I should check or decide.

## 8. Communication

- I'm learning, so **explain your reasoning** briefly when you make non-obvious decisions.
- If there are several reasonable approaches, mention the trade-offs and recommend one.
- If you're unsure about something, say so instead of guessing.
- Point out bugs, security issues or bad practices you notice, even outside the current task.

---

## 9. Git (if used)

- Write clear commit messages: a short summary line, then details if needed.
- Don't commit secrets, build output or dependency folders (keep `.gitignore` up to date).
- Ask before committing, pushing, or changing branches.
